\section*{Preface}

This report is written by seven 4th semester robotic engineering students from the University of Southern Denmark in spring 2016. The report is based on the 4th semester's project.
It is aimed at people with basic knowledge in the following disciplines: Digital programmable electronics, Embedded Programming, Control Engineering and Computer systems. Furthermore, in order to understand the content of this report, it is considered a prerequisite that the project introduction has been read \footnote{Projektoplæg - RB-RKO4 forår 2016}.
This report describes the theory and analysis involved in designing the controller used to control the Pan \& Tilt system, as well as the motor driver and the application used to give commands to the system.
The report is written as a conclusion to the project and contains documentation of the process and the experiences gained. It should therefore be possible to recreate the project using this report.
