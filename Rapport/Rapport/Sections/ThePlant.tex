\section{Whatever you want}

The purpose of these tests is to analyse and generate a blackbox model for the motor based on its step response. 

Setup:
The motor was set up with a switch connected to a power supply set at the desired voltage to test. This would create a physical step response from the motor when the switch was toggled. The two encoders output on the EMG30 are open collectors, so the outputs were connected to pull-up resistance to produce a desired signal. The pull-up resistors for these tests was picked to be around 300 ohm.

An oscilloscope was set to measure the two encoders outputs on its each own individual channel. The sampling starts on an edge trigger with a sampling rate of 2 mHz and stops the sampling after 0.5 seconds.
These 2 set of samples would together be the data defining an step response.
