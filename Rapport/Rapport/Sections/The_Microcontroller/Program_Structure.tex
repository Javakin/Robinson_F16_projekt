\subsection{Program Structure}
\label{sec:ProgramStructure}

Given the above mentioned requirements, a task diagram for the system was created, here the program were to handle two different sources of user input, in a manner that would not effect the application. 

Insert task diagram here 


walk through the system, separating the program into tasks starting from the block diagram. ( see the criteria in Morten's ppt. )

one task one input queue

what drivers where required to achieve the goal of the program,

now add the used semaphores at critical sections

Now when the task diagram has been made, it is time to considerer possible structural weakness such as deadlocks and handling og queues.
