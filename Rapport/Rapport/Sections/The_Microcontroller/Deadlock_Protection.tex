\subsection{Deadlock Protection}
\label{sec:DeadlockProtection}

here three criterias neads to be held for a dead lock to take place 
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	
	\item Mutual exclusion
	
	\item Hold and wait 
	
	\item No preemption
	
	\item Circular wait (add source XXXX)
	
\end{enumerate}

All four conditions needs to hold true in order for a deadlock to occur. You can therefore provide a deadlock-free environment by avoiding one of the conditions. 

Here we remove circular wait ...

Implementation of this idea ...
