\section{The Microcontroller}
\label{sec:TheMicrocontroller}

 Given the design requirements in section \ref{sec:RequirementsSpecification}, and the block diagram in section \ref{sec:TheSystem}. This includes all the functionality that is to be placed in the microcontroller. From here the next stage is to define the content of these blocks, and how they interact with each other. 
 
 The microcontroller is to establish an application programmer interface (API) to the P\&T driver placed in the FPGA. The microcontroller will also run the application that uses this interface in order to help the user achieve his/her goal, which is to control the spotlight.
 
 The program will be written in the C language, and it will be documented using task diagrams and state machines.

\subsection{Overview}
The functionality was meant as a fully dressed system containing all the features that would be needed while working with a real spotlight. However, not all features were primary requirements, making their implementation optional. This meant some of the features
 
\textbf{The joystick:} A working driver was made. Even thought a driver was made for the joystick, it the the corresponding API was not. Therefore this
