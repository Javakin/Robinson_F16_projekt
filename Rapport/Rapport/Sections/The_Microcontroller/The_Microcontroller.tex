\label{sec:TheMicrocontroller}

Write an introduction to this section:\\
- what is this sections domain of responsibility (inputs and outputs)\\
- why did we put it here (is properly being handled in the "over all system layout")\\
- the notation used in this domain and why(task diagrams and state machines)


Sections\\
- the operating system (why freeRTOS)\\
- the program structure task diagram and creation process hereby\\

- the api for every driver. \\
- the event queue, its usage and limitations (why and what) and the shared state memory.\\
- deadlock protection. \\
- The SPI-master state machine and timing (why not use the build in module) (the measurements of bandwidth). \\
- The application (state mashines)

\subsection{Overview}
The above mentioned functionality was ment as a fully dressed system containing all the features that would be needed while working with a real spotlight. However, not all features was primary requirements, which makes it okay that it never got implemented. 
 
The joystick: Even thought a driver was made for the joystick, it the the corresponding API was not. Therefore this 

Point at a specific location. 

This is the functions that did not made it to the implementation

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	
	\item ps2 controller and its corresponding api
	
	\item calculating the tack-position from the relative coordinates given by the application  
	
	\item follow a waking person
	

\end{enumerate}
