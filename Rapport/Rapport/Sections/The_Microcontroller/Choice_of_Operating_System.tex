\subsection{Choice of Operating System}
\label{sec:ChoiceofOperatingSystem}

Since it is safe to assume that this program will be using multipliable task, an operating system (OS) is required. This OS must support the ARM Cortex M-4 processor, which is used in this project. It must be supported by Code Composer Studio, which is the software used for programming the processor. 

Using a Real Time Operating System freeRTOS would give the advantages of preemptive scheduling. Being able to preempt a low priority task to pave the way for a task of higher priority will ensure better performance if the project have a serden sive to it.
