\subsection{SPI-Master}
\label{sec:SPIMaster}

The microcontroller have to share information with the FPGA, and according to the requirements mentioned in section \ref{sec:Primaryrequirements}, this communication has to happen using Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). The protocol will operate as descriped in section \ref{sec:SPIcommunication}. It is therefore important that this link never will be a bottleneck for the system application. 

The requirements of the minimum bit-rate depends on what data that needs to be send, and how often it needs to send it. Since the PID-controller is placed in the FPGA, the application only needs to update the current position once every 5 ms, which is the minimal delay that freeRTOS can put on a task. 

The length of the messages sent is defined by the driver placed in the FPGA. As described in section \ref{sec:Implementation} all messages will have the length of 14 bits. Updating both pan and tilt requires two messages. Considering all other messages but the main pulling sequence as negligible results in a total bitrate of:

\begin{equation}
Bitrate = \frac{
14 bit * 2	
}{
0.05s
} = 5.600 bit/sec 
\end{equation}

The Cortex M4 has a built-in freescale spi module, that supports four different variations of spi, see appendix \ref{sec:CortexM4Datasheet}. However, implementing the spi from scratch, gives the highest degree of control over the process, which is preferable in this project.

The state machine for the task is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:SPI-master}. It consists of three states and is initiated waiting for a message to transmit from the spi\_tx\_queue. When a message is pulled from the queue, it jumps to the send state, and after sending the message, the received message will be handled by the P\&T API in the Receive task. From here it will only switch back to the idle state if the API call was successful, else it will continue until it succeeds. 


\subsubsection{Performance Test} 
\label{sec:PerformanceTest}
After implementing the the SPI-master task in the final application, the max bit-rate was tested by overloading the spi\_tx\_queue, and giving the SPI-master task High priority in the OS. This made the the task perform at maximum capacity. The measurements of the SPI connection can be seen in figure \ref{fig:HightPerformance}. Since it is able to transmit messages of 14 bots at 7.7 kHz the bitrate will be the product of these two values giving the result $107 kbit/sek$
