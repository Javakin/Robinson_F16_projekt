\label{sec:SPIMaster}

The microcomtroller have to share information with the FPGA, and according to the requirements mentiond in section \ref{sec:Primaryrequirements}, this will happen using a 

and for this requirement it is required to handle the 

It is time to concidder the stuff that is done 

using the build in free-scale spi-module in the TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller, or creating the protocol from scratch. 

The making of the state machine that is the SPI-master

A state is only a state if you have to wait till you move on
