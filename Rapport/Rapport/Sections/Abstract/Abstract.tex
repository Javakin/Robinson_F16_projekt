\section{Abstract}

The purpose of this paper is to show how to make a controller and how to use it to control a spotlight consisting of two connected frames, two motors and one light. Precise motor control is an essential requirement in most applications involving any kind of actuators that need to behave in a predictable and controlled way. A spotlight capable of relative precise movement is important when performing on a stage. In order to make a controller, several measurements of the systems response to different voltages have been analysed. Using Matlab and control theory, the values of the controller have been estimated. The results show; with the right controller, the system is easily controllable and will behave in a predictable way.
